              <h3> Biography </h3>
              <p>Hello! I'm Benjamin Le and am a Master of Engineering Student in the Data Science program under the EECS department. I received my undergraduate degree for EECS here at UC Berkeley as well and loved it so much here, that I decided to come back for another go! Beyond my interest in data science and computing, I also enjoy watching my Bay Area sport teams win championships, hiking on clear blue sky days, and taking pictures of beautiful views.</p>

              <h3> Research Interests </h3>
              <p>Although I don't conduct research as a part of my Master's program, my interests lie under the fields of Machine Learning and Large Scale Data Mining and Analysis. Currently, I am working on a Capstone project with 4 others to analyze Online Video Session Data in order to detect anomalies within a video delivery ecosystem and to classify types of online video subscribers.<p>
              <p>From this class, I hope to understand parallel programing paradigms better to become a better parallel application programmer. I also wish to learn more about parallel distributed frameworks such as Spark and MapReduce. I also look forward to my first experience with GPU programming.</p>
